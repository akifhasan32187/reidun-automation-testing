# Comprehensive Web Automation & Script Execution Using Selenium and Flask

I developed a robust web-based automation platform that integrates Selenium WebDriver for automating profile updates, brand settings, system configurations and bank and invoice settings on the test-reidun.rebingtest.com website. The project included dynamic form validation, password management, UI theme testing, and spell-checking for Norwegian language inputs. Using Flask, I built an interface to execute Python scripts, log results, and capture output/errors in real-time. The application enhances efficiency by automating login/logout processes, form handling, and validation tasks, while providing error handling and detailed result reporting.
